--- Exercise 1 ---
Use a for loop to print each odd number from 1 to 20.

--- Exercise 2 ---
Write code that accepts an input until the user guesses a magic word.
Give them a reasonable amount of guesses until the loop ends by itself.
Print a message and break the loop when their guess is correct.

--- Exercise 3 ---
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a peron's age.
If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10;
and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write code in which you ask the users for an age, and then
tell them the cost of a movie ticket.

--- Exercise 4 ---
a. Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they break the loop.
   As they enter each topping, print a message saying you'll add that topping to their pizza.

b. Modify your pizza program to include a list of the toppings the user enters.
   When the loop breaks, print a message confirming their order has been saved, along with a list of their desired toppings.

c. Before adding a topping to the list of desired toppings, check whether the topping is already added.
   Tell the user that that topping already exists in their order.
