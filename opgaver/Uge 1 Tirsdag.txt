--- Exercise 1 ---
Class: Counter
A simple tally counter that increments its value by 1 every click.
Create the class with the following functionality:
- 'Empty' constructor (no positional arguments required)
- 'value' variable
- 'Click()' method
- 'Reset()' method
Decide how to display your current value: After each function call? Only when asked?
Create an object and test your class!


--- Exercise 2 ---
Class: Die
A 6-sided die that can be rolled!
- Consider how/if to keep track of your 6 sides.
- Implement a 'Roll()' method, which returns a random integer (1 - 6)
hint: The Random class is very helpful


--- Exercise 3 ---
Class: Die
An n-sided die that can be rolled!
(If you want to keep your old class intact, you can create this one with a different name.)
- This time, every die you create takes an int (sides) as a parameter.
- Consider which changes you have to make.
- Implement the 'Roll()' function.


--- Exercise 4 ---
Class: Student
For the purpose of this exercise, a student has a name and a test score based on the tests they've taken.
- 'AddTest(score)'
- 'GetTotalScore()'
- 'GetAverageScore()'
Which variables does your class need when you construct it?
Implement the class and create an object to test it!


--- Exercise 5 ---
Class: BankAccount
- Consider which fields/variables a bank account might need.
- Consider what behaviour it needs to implement.
- Now write the class! Both Constructor and a few required methods.
Create an object to test the behaviour of your new class!
